<a href="#the-purpose-for-leaflethex" class="anchor"></a>The Purpose for Leaflethex</h2>
<p><code>Leaflethex</code> is primarily a proof of concept for rendering leafletJS functionality in R by running the javascript though an htmlwidget.</p>
<p>It also contains a function <code><a href="../reference/addHexbin.html">addHexbin()</a></code> for applying a hexbin layer to a leaflet map</p>

<a href="#how-to-use-leaflethex-for-the-hexbin-layer" class="anchor"></a>How to use leaflethex for the Hexbin Layer</h2>
<p>If you are interested in using the hexbin plugin that comes along with leaflethex, the function <code><a href="../reference/addHexbin.html">addHexbin()</a></code> can be used which has a similar API to the rest of the Leaflet R functions that add layers to leaflet maps such as addCircles, addMarkers, etc.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>

<li><p>Copy the desired chunk of JS code that modifies a map object into its own file into a new folder (will refer to this as example.js)</p></li>
<li><p>Edit the JS code to replace any reference of <code>map</code> with the keyword <code>this</code> so that the loaded plugin can attach to the given map instead of creating a new map. Note: if the JS Code extensively uses DOM manipulation more work may be needed to make it compatible</p></li>
<li><p>Download the libraries that the code depends on such as jquery, leaflet, d3 etc as .js files</p></li>
<li><p>Combine these .js files into one .js file by simply copying them all into the same file (will refer to this as deps.js)</p></li>
<li>
<p>Create the plugin with <code><a href="../reference/pluginFactory.html">pluginFactory()</a></code></p>
