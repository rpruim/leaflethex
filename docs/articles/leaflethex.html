<a href="#the-purpose-for-leaflethex" class="anchor"></a>The Purpose for Leaflethex</h2>
<p>Leaflethex is primarily a proof of concept for rendering leafletJS functionality in R by running the javascript though an htmlwidget.</p>
<p>It also contains a function <code><a href="../reference/addHexbin.html">addHexbin()</a></code> for applying a hexbin layer to a leaflet map</p>

<a href="#how-to-use-leaflethex-for-the-hexbin-layer" class="anchor"></a>How to use leaflethex for the Hexbin Layer</h2>
<p>If you are interested in using the hexbin plugin that comes along with leaflethex, the function <code><a href="../reference/addHexbin.html">addHexbin()</a></code> can be used which has a similar API to the rest of the Leaflet R functions that add layers to leaflet maps such as <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/leaflet/man/map-layers.html">leaflet::addCircles()</a></code>, <code><a href="https://rdrr.io/pkg/leaflet/man/map-layers.html">leaflet::addMarkers()</a></code>, etc.</p>
<p>The default use bins geopoints into hexagonal regions and used size and/or color to represent the number of points in each bin.</p>

<a href="#using-leaflethex-for-arbitrary-leafletjs-functionality-overview" class="anchor"></a>Using leaflethex for arbitrary LeafletJS functionality: Overview</h2>
<p>Leaflethex also provides a mechanism for creating hooks to arbitrary javascript code via <code><a href="../reference/pluginFactory.html">pluginFactory()</a></code>. To modify existing javascript code that modfies a leaflet map so that it can be used from within R using the leaflet R package</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make a copy the JS code that modifies a map object.</p>
Place this code in a new file and place the file in a new folder. (In the example below, this file will be called <code>example.js</code>.)</li>
<li>
<p>Edit the JS code to replace any reference of <code>map</code> with the keyword <code>this</code> so that the loaded plugin can attach to the given map instead of creating a new map.</p>
Note: if the JS Code makes extensive use of DOM manipulation more work may be needed to make it compatible.</li>
<li>Download the libraries that the code depends on such as jquery, leaflet, d3, etc. as .js files.</li>
<li>
<p>Combine these .js files into a single .js file.</p>
(In the example below, this file will be called <code>deps.js</code>.)</li>
<li>
<p>Create the plugin with <code><a href="../reference/pluginFactory.html">pluginFactory()</a></code>.</p>
