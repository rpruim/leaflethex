# leaflethex

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of leaflethex is to create hexbin layers that can be added to plots made
with the leaflet package.

This is a work in progress and is not yet a functional R package.  Stay tuned!

## Installation

You can install the released version of leaflethex from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("leaflethex")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rpruim/leaflethex")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(leaflethex)
df = tibble(
  lat = rnorm(100),
  lng = rnorm(100),
  size = runif(100, 5, 20),
  color = sample(colors(), 100)
)
map <- leaflet::leaflet(df) %>% 
  leaflet::addTiles() %>% 
  leaflethex::add_hexbin(
    radius = 19, 
    lowEndColor = "yellow", 
    highEndColor="red")
map
```

## Parameters for add_hexbin

* `data` - data frame or tibble - alternate data to use for this hexbin instead of default map data
* `radius` - numeric - choose the base size for the hexagons
* `opacity` - decimal - between 0.0 and 1.0 - choose the percent of opacity for the hexagons
* `lowEndColor` - string - choose the color for the smaller hexagons
* `highEndColor` - string - choose the color for the larger hexagons

## How to use the Plugin Factory function

#. Copy the desired chunk of JS code that modifies a map object into its own file into a new folder (will refer to this as example.js)
#. Edit the JS code to replace any reference of `map` with the keyword `this` so that the loaded plugin can attach to the given map instead of creating a new map
#. Download the libraries that the code depends on such as jquery, leaflet, d3 etc as .js files
#. Combine these .js files into one .js file by simply copying them all into the same file (will refer to this as deps.js)
#. Create the plugin with `pluginFactory()`
addJS <- leaflethex::pluginFactory("Some JS Plugin", system.file("js", "", package = "leaflethex"), "example.js", "deps.js")
    ```{r eval=FALSE}
      new_plugin_function <- pluginFactory("Name of Plugin", "path/of/parent/folder/"), "deps.js")
      # Create a basic leaflet map
      leaflet::leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% new_plugin_function()
      
    ```




## How to Use Pure JS Leaflet Plugin Functions in R

#. Create a new R script `add_plugin_name.R`
#. Add a single function that takes `map` as its first parameter and returns it as the return value

    ```{r eval = FALSE}
      add_hexbin <- function(map, data = NULL) {
        data <- if(is.null(data)) leaflet::getMapData(map)
        map
      }
    ```


#. Add the leaflet-esri.R file to the R directory or copy its functions into the new R file
#. Set aside the R Code and find the complete desired javascript code
#. Copy the code into a .js file then wrap the code in a `function()` as below

    ```js
      function(el, x, data = null) {
        // Your JS Code
      }
    ```
    
#. Modify this file to use the data parameter as needed, this parameter will be used for data points but also mapping options like radius or color or anything else one needs to pass into the js function

#. Back to the R Code, create a Plugin with the `createPlugin()` function.

    ```{r eval=FALSE}
    # Load JS plugin - Hexbin Example
    hexbinPlugin <- createPlugin(
                      "Hexbin", "1.0.0", # Name and Verison
                      src= system.file("js", "", package = "leaflethex"), #Parent folder of the     dependencies and stylesheets
                      script = "deps.js", # JS File containing the dependencies
                      stylesheet="hexbin.css") 
    
    ```
    
#. Using the JS file created earlier, load the code into a single String

    ``` {r eval=FALSE}
      hexbinJS <- readr::read_file(system.file("js", "hexbin.js", package = "leaflethex"))
    ```

#. Apply the Plugin to the map parameter and render the Javascript in the recently created string with the `OnRender()` function

    ```{r eval=FALSE}
      # Pipe the the plugin into the given map
      map <- map %>%
      registerPlugin(hexbinPlugin) %>%
        # Add your custom JS logic here. The `this` keyword
        # refers to the Leaflet (JS) map object.
        onRender(hexbinJS, data=mapData)
    
      map  # show the map
    ```


#. To pass Data from R to JS, create an S3 Object with the desired data

    ```{r eval=FALSE}
       # Build MapData from given data or mapData if none provided
       mapData <- if(!is.null(data)) data else leaflet::getMapData(map)
       # Add parameters to be passed to the JS plugin
       mapData <- list(mapData = mapData,
           radius = radius,
           opacity = opacity, # Additional Parameters
           duration = duration,
           lowEndColor = lowEndColor,
           highEndColor = highEndColor
       )
       class(mapData) <- "options" # This is necessary to pass the object as a JSON object instead of a JSON Array, much easier to deal with on the JS side
    ```

#. Then as shown above, it should be passed to the data parameter of OnRender

#. The Object comes out the outside in the JS World as a JSON Object
